# Discount Code Architecture
To build the system a simple, classic tech stack was chosen. PHP as the core language 
with PostgreSQL and Redis for data storage. Any webserver can be used, but Apache is 
used as an example. A service for sending transactional mail is also used, but no recommendation made.
